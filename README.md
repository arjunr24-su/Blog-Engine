# Blog Engine Project Report

### Project Overview

The blog engine is being developed using Rust with the Rocket framework. The application aims to create a fully functional online platform to render and display blog content with features such as content aggregation, Markdown parsing, post organization, and dynamic routing.

### Current Status

#### Features Implemented

1. **Basic Structure**:
   - The project is structured into directories for templates and static files (CSS/JavaScript).
   - The main file is `src/main.rs`, where the Rocket server is set up.

2. **Routing**:
   - **Home Page**: Implemented at the root path (`/`), displaying a welcome message.
   - **Post Rendering**: Implemented a route (`/post`) to fetch and display blog articles from an external API (Dev.to).
   - **Category Pages**: Implemented a route (`/category/<category_name>`) to display posts by category, with example posts.

3. **Template Rendering**:
   - Integrated Tera templates for rendering HTML pages. 
   - The `index.html.tera` file has been set up to include a basic layout and navigation.

4. **JavaScript Integration**:
   - A JavaScript file (`scripts.js`) has been created to handle dark/light mode toggling.
   - Utilized `localStorage` to remember the user's theme preference.

5. **External API Integration**:
   - Successfully fetching blog articles from Dev.to using the `reqwest` crate.

6. **Static Files**:
   - Set up a static file server to serve CSS and JavaScript files.
   - Bootstrap has been integrated for styling.

#### Technologies Used

- **Rust**: The programming language for the backend.
- **Rocket**: The web framework for building the server.
- **Tera**: The templating engine for HTML.
- **Reqwest**: The HTTP client for fetching external data.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive CSS styling.

### Pending Tasks

1. **Markdown Parsing**: Implement functionality to parse fetched content into Markdown and render it correctly.
   
2. **Dynamic Content for Categories**: Populate category pages with actual blog posts instead of placeholder data.

3. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling for API requests and data parsing to improve user experience.

4. **UI Improvements**: Refine the user interface for better aesthetics and usability.

5. **Testing**: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability of features.

6. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for the code and usage of the blog engine.

### Conclusion

The project is progressing well, with a significant portion of the foundational features implemented. Most of the key requirements are met, while a few remain in progress. Continued focus on the remaining tasks will be essential to complete the project successfully.
